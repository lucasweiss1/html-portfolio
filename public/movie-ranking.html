<h1>The Best Movies According to Lucas</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Imitation Game</h3>
  <p>This is my favorite historically based film. I love the cast as well.</p>
<h3>Catch me if you can</h3>
  <p>As a pilot, it is only natural for me to include this on my list. The fact<br>
   that this is based on a true story is mind blowing to me. </p>
<h4>21</h4>
  <p> A good plot and story line. I kind of learned how counting cards worked after<br>
   watching this.</p>
